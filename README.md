# TimeCalculator

## Installation
1. [download Microsoft PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/install).
2. Build and deploy the project with Visual Studio
3. The default keybind for PowerToys Command Palette is WIN + ALT + Space.
4. type "reload" to reload the extensions after building and deploying.
5. Start typing "Time Calculator" into the main search field, and choose the option for Time Calculator.
6. If I can figure out how to add this to WinGet, I will add instructions for installing that way, which would be easier.

## Useage

- Times must be entered in h:mm or hh:mm format.
- enter "no wrap" or "nowrap" at the end to allow the result to extend beyond 0-24 hours.
